- 👋 Hi, I’m @redhatrap
- 👀 I’m interested in developing and sharing hints, tips, tricks, & best practices for Linux, Ansible automation, and KVM Virtualization.
- 🌱 I’m currently implementing these technologies in my homelab, and to share with others who are learning or for those who can apply these sample and concepts in their daily jobs
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate with others about these and related problem-solving techniques useful to classic administration or contemporary DevOps.
